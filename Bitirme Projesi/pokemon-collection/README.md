# Getting Started with Pokemon Collection

This project was powered by [React](https://reactjs.org),
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com),
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co).

## `Security Warning!`

In this project I used .env for hiding Firebase API key. If you want to use my project. Be sure you already have firestore API key.

### `Get Started! `
First of all, install dependencies with "npm install" and then run the app in the development mode with "npm start"

### `C'mon! Give it a try!`
### `Thank You! üôè`
